And when you always apologize first, it might be a sign of something called anxious attachment \u2014 where love feels tied to keeping the peace at all costs. It\u2019s super common, especially when deep down you\u2019re afraid of abandonment. But here\u2019s what\u2019s true: You deserve a relationship where your needs, voice, and boundaries matter too.
